# Toy Problem - Ruby

## Find Unique Elements of an Array

Given an array of items (in this case, just strings and integers, though your program should be
able to handle booleans and floats as well), run through the array and then return an array of
the items that appear only once in the original array.

For example, given `[1, 2, "three", "three", 4]`, we should get back `[1, 2, 4]`.

You may find it worthwhile to use the [Ruby array class
documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html), but know that there is no single
method (that already exists) that can solve this for you, and that you can solve this problem
without using any of the fancier array methods.
